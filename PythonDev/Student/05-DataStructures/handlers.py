# TODO 1:
# Define some handler functions to process specific FIX tokens. Name the functions proc8(), proc9(), proc35(), etc.
# Each function should receive a value parameter (this is the value for the token, as read in from the file).
# Provide dummy implementation for each function for now (e.g. just print the name of the function, and the value of the parameter).
