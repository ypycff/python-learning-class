    "# Exercise 1:  Using universal operators and functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Universal operators and functions are NumPy array methods that automatically execute on each element in the array, without the need for you to write explicit looping code. Universal functions are more concise than loops, and far more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using universal operators, convert all the precipitation values from millimetres into the following units. In each case, print out the new array values:\n",
    "-\tCentimetres (to convert from mm to cm, divide by 10)\n",
    "-\tInches (to convert from cm to inches, divide by 2.54)\n",
    "\n",
    "The inches values will be displayed to machine accuracy, e.g. 0.99212598. You don’t need this much accuracy; 4 decimal places is perfectly adequate. Think about how you can convert the values to 4 decimal places; if you’re thinking of using a loop, think again. You hardly ever use loops with NumPy arrays, because they are grossly inefficient. Instead, your first though should be “I wonder if NumPy has a universal function to do that…”. As it happens, NumPy has an around() universal function to round all values in an array to the specified number of decimal places. See here for details:\n",
    "https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.around.html\n",
    "Use the around() function to round all the inches values to 4 decimal places, then print the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’ve got all that working, combine your operations into a single statement that does all of the following:\n",
    "- Converts the precipitation values from mm to inches, to 4 decimal places.\n",
    "You can write arbitrarily complex statements using universal operators and functions 😊\n"

    "\n",

    "-\tThe quartiles (i.e. 25th percentile, 50th percentile, and 75th percentile). The correct answers are 0.0, 0.0669, and 0.315 respectively. \n"

    "-\tThe mean value in the “minimum temperature” column in the temps array\n",
    "-\tThe mean value in the “maximum temperature” column in the temps array\n",
    "\n",
    "Now create a NumPy array containing these two values. Print the array values – they should be [6.0 12.4], i.e. the mean minimum temperature over the year was 6, and the mean maximum temperature over the year was 12.4. Also print the array shape – it should be (2,).\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to see how the temperatures for each day compared to these means. For example, consider the temperatures for the first day of the year:\n",
    "-\tFor the first day of the year, the minimum temperature is 3.1. Compared to the mean minimum temperature of 6 for the whole year, this day is 2.9 cooler.\n",
    "-\tFor the first day of the year, the maximum temperature is 9.7. Compared to the mean maximum temperature of 12.4 for the whole year, this day is 2.7 cooler.\n",
    "-\tThus, the result we’d like to obtain for the first day is [-2.9 -2.7].\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think how you can perform this calculation for every day of the year – i.e. take the temps array of shape (365,2) and subtract the array containing mean min and max temps of shape (2,). These arrays have different shape, but NumPy’s broadcasting rules allows you to do it.\n",
