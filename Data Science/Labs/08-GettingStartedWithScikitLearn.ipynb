    "-\tImport the Seaborn module.\n",
    "-\tCall the Seaborn function load_dataset() to load the ‘iris’ dataset. This function loads the data into a Pandas DataFrame object – store it in a variable named iris.\n",
    "-\tCall iris.head() and print the results. This displays the first 5 rows in the dataset, by default. Note you can pass a parameter into the head() function to display a different number of rows; e.g. iris.head(20) would get the first 20 rows.\n",
    "-\tCall iris.info() and print the results. This displays useful information about the dataset, such as the name and type of each column, and the number of rows that have a value for each column.\n",
