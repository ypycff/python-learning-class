It‚Äôs important to understand that every Pandas DataFrame (or Series) has an index, whether you create the index yourself or whether Pandas creates it for you.\n",
    "-\tThe index doesn‚Äôt have a name. That‚Äôs OK, but generally you‚Äôll find it handy to give the index a name so you can refer to it when manipulating the DataFrame later. You can assign a name to the index as follows: `df.index.name = 'Index'`\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise you‚Äôll save the DataFrame to a CSV file and/or Excel spreadsheet, and then load it back in again. You‚Äôll use the following functions to save the data (here, we assume df is the name of your DataFrame object):\n",

    "\n",
    "`df.to_excel(filename, index=True/False, header=True/False)`\n",

    "The index parameter indicates whether you want to write the index column to the file. Set this flag to True, so that the CSV file and/or Excel spreadsheet will have a column containing the index value for all the rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The header parameter indicates whether you want to write the names of the columns to the file. Set this flag to True as well, so that the first line in the CSV file or Excel spreadsheet will indicate the names of the columns. This makes the data more meaningful for anyone using it.\n",
    "Run your code and verify the CSV file and/or Excel spreadsheet have been created, with index values and column names as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now add code to read data back in from the CSV file and/or Excel spreadsheet. Use the following functions:\n",

    "The header parameter tells Pandas that row 0 in the file contains column names, rather than real data. Therefore, Pandas will read row 0 and use the information therein to deduce the names of the columns for the DataFrame.\n",
