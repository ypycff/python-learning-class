This dataset is specially designed for use in linear regression, to predict house prices based on features such as the age of a house, the proportion of land in the town allocated for housing use or industrial use, etc.\n",

There are 506 rows (representing 506 houses) and 13 columns (representing the 13 features for each house). Generally it‚Äôs beneficial to convert the data into a Pandas DataFrame, which is easier to work with than a 2D array. You can do this as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "A common approach in machine learning is to split the samples in a dataset into two portions:\n",
    "-\tA relatively large portion of samples (e.g. 80%) that can be used to train the model.\n",

    "-\tThe function returns a bunch of arrays, according to the specified split. In our example, X_train and X_test will hold the ‚Äútraining‚Äù and ‚Äútesting‚Äù portions of X, and y_train and y_test will hold the ‚Äútraining‚Äù and ‚Äútest‚Äù portions of y.\n",
