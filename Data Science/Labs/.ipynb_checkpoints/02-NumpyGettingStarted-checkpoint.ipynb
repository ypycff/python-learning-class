    "A common requirement when working with datasets is that you want to reshape a linear 1D array into multiple dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the Bergen precipitation data is a 1D array of 365 values, but you might want to process it as 52 weeks x 7 days. This would make it easier to perform tasks such as comparing rainfall values for every Saturday, calculating the ratio of rainfall during weekdays compared to weekends, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you reshape an array, you have to make sure the number of elements in the original array is compatible with the shape you’re aiming at. For example, you can’t reshape a (365,) array into a (52,7) array because 52 x 7 = 364, not 365…\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the first step is to create a NumPy array that contains just the first 364 values of data. Once you have this, reshape it into a 2D array containing 52 rows and 7 columns per row. Print out the 2D array and its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then print the following info:\n",
    "-\tPrecipitation for the first week. \n",
    "-\tPrecipitation for the last week. \n",
    "-\tPrecipitation for the first weekend. (For simplicity, pretend 1 Jan 2019 was a Monday, which means the Saturday and Sunday in any week would be days 5 and 6. In actual fact, 1 Jan 2019 was a Tuesday not a Monday, but let’s pretend this is fake news!)\n",
