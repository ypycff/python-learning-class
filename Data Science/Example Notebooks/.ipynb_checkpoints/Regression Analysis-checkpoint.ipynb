    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to demonstrate to a relatively novice python data scientist how easy it is to perform complex data analysis on market data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The piece of analysis that will be performed is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tCorrelate the daily returns of PXD stock against the daily returns of a small basket of securities (SPY, Gold, Natural Gas and Oil)\n",
    "2.\tPerform a regression analysis of PXD against the basket\n",
    "3.\tExtend this to perform a regression analysis of an arbitrary security against the same basket\n",
    "4.\tExport the data to an excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will touch on the following data science topics:\n",
    "- The pandas, numpy and matplotlib python packages\n",
    "- Importing data from csv files into a pandas DataFrame\n",
    "- The rows, columns and index of a DataFrame\n",
    "- Accessing data from a DataFrame along its rows and columns\n",
    "- Slicing Data\n",
    "- Time Series\n",
    "- Merging multiple DataFames into a single larger DataFrame\n",
    "- Exporting DataFames into an Excel spreadsheet\n",

    "Users will see how to execute the following operations:\n",
    "1.\tCalculate the daily returns of a security\n",
    "2.\tCorrelate the daily returns of securities\n",

    "- adding extensions to a chrome browser\n",

    "It is often the case that users will give a package an alias when it is imported. Users can decide on the names of any aliases they use, but the conventional aliases for the packages we will use are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magics**<br>\n",
    "The line %matploblib inline is a `python magic`.\n",
